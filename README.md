Project requirements re: Milestone 1


* Static front end project: Write custom HTML5 and CSS3 code to create a website of at least 3 pages, or (if using a single scrolling page), at least 3 separate page areas.
* Information Architecture: Incorporate a main navigation menu and structured layout (you might want to use Bootstrap to accomplish this).
* Documentation: Write a README.md file for your project that explains what the project does and the value that it provides to its users.
* Version Control: Use Git & GitHub for version control.
* Attribution: Maintain clear separation between code written by you and code from external sources (e.g. libraries or tutorials). Attribute any code from external sources to its source via comments above the code and (for larger dependencies) in the README.
* Deployment: Deploy the final version of your code to a hosting platform such as GitHub Pages.
